# Dotfiles

Dotfiles focused on creating an intuitive and beautiful terminal experience.


## Thanks

Thanks to [Thoughtbot] and [Dragan] for the inspiration and the framework this repo uses.
I chose not to fork one of their repos because I don't intend to contribute my personal
preferences upstream. That being said, the framework/organization of this repo was
originally designed by Thoughtbot and Dragan was my inspiration for formally tracking
my dotfiles and using the Thoughtbot layout.
